This is the README for the client for my capston project.

The application will be a way for people to get travel recommendations. It stores information on user interests and recommends traveling to cities on certain dates based on events happening on those dates.

The event data is from the eventful.com API / feed.

-   The Rails server stores the event information as well as information about users.
-   The Ember client will provide the UX.

Planning materials include:
